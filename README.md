## Features

### Super Admin Portal
- Separate login page at `/admin/login` — no company selection required
- Restricted to accounts with the `SUPERUSER` role only
- Full company management across all tenants:
  - Create, edit, and soft-delete companies
  - Activate / deactivate companies (inactive companies are hidden from the tenant login page)
  - Upload a company logo (PNG, JPG, WebP, SVG — max 2 MB)
- Company logo is displayed in the tenant sidebar; falls back to a helmet-safety icon if none is set
- Dedicated `_LayoutAdmin` layout with a minimal dark navigation bar
- Super admins have no assigned `UserCompany`; all service calls that need a company ID resolve it automatically from the `{company}` route segment instead

### Permit Management
- Create and manage safety permits across 8 certificate types:
  - Hot Work, Confined Space, Radiation, Excavation, Isolation
  - Method Statement, Lifting & Hoisting, Override
- Permit lifecycle: Draft → Pending → Approved → Suspended → KIV → Closed / ClosedNoAction / Overdue / Rejected
- File attachments (PDF, DOCX, JPG, PNG — up to 5 files, 3 MB each)
- PDF export of permit documents via headless Chrome (isolated in `PermitPdfService`)

### Workflow Engine
- Configurable multi-step approval workflows per company
- Workflow history and full audit trail
- Background jobs for automatic permit closure and auto-resume logic (configurable threshold via `SUSPEND_AUTORESUME_DAYS`)
- Enhanced three-page workflow UI (runs alongside original routes):
  - **Overview** (`/workflow/overview`) — 4 KPI cards (Total, Active, Inactive, Permits Assigned), status doughnut chart, top-6 permits-by-workflow bar chart, summary Kendo grid
  - **Manage** (`/workflow/manage`) — filter pills (ALL / ACTIVE / INACTIVE), Kendo grid with step count and permit count columns, inline "New Workflow" modal that redirects to Builder on create
  - **Builder** (`/workflow/builder/{id}`) — two-column view: left = workflow info form with mini stat cards; right = visual step pipeline with inline Bootstrap collapse panels per step (General + Approvers tabs), Kendo grid approver picker modal

### Multi-Tenancy
- Each company operates in an isolated namespace
- Tenant route pattern: `/{company}/{controller}/{action}`
- All data scoped to the tenant company
- Company name and logo injected into every tenant view via `AppControllerBase`
- `ICurrentUserService.GetCurrentCompanyId()` resolves the active company for any service call:
  - Normal users → their assigned `UserCompany.Id`
  - Super admins (no assigned company) → `{company}` route value from the current request URL

### Real-time Notifications
- SignalR `NotificationHub` pushes live notifications to connected users
- In-app notification list with Title, Message, read/archived state
- SMTP email alerts via MailKit

### Sites & Location
- Manage work sites with GPS coordinates
- Site map dashboard overlay

### Recycle Bin & Soft Delete
- All core entities implement `ISoftDeletable` — deletions are soft by default
- Cascade soft-delete: removing a Company cascades to Sites, Workflows, Permits, Attachments, and WorkflowHistories
- `RecycleBinController` exposes restore functionality for soft-deleted records across 5 tabs:
  - **Permits** — company-scoped
  - **Users** — company-scoped
  - **Roles** — global entity (not company-scoped); shown across all tenants; includes `Description` and soft-delete audit fields
  - **Workflow Steps** — company-scoped
  - **Companies** — visible to Super Users only
- Cascade restore recovers children deleted within the same cascade operation (10-second window)

### App Settings
- Per-company key-value configuration stored in `AppSettingCategory` / `AppSetting` entities
- Settings are grouped by category and scoped by `CompanyId`
- Seeded with 3 default categories and 13 keys per company:

| Category | Keys |
|---|---|
| **General** | `application_domain`, `user_create_limit`, `upload_max_file_size`, `upload_max_file_count`, `upload_allowed_file_types` |
| **Email** | `smtp_server`, `smtp_port`, `sender_name`, `sender_email`, `email_username`, `email_password` (encrypted) |
| **Workflow** | `suspended_autoresume_days` |

### Reporting & Export
- Kendo UI grid-based permit report with date range, location, certificate type, permit holder, and status filters
- **Reports Dashboard** — activated on "View Report" click, showing:
  - 5 KPI cards: Total, Pending, Approved, Closed, Overdue (overdue card highlights red when count > 0)
  - Status distribution doughnut chart
  - Monthly trend stacked bar chart (always last 12 months, independent of date filter)
  - Top 8 locations horizontal bar chart
- 4 report tabs: All Permits (Kendo Grid), Overdue (paginated, 20 per page), By Holder (with approval rate progress bar), By Location
- Excel export via ClosedXML

### System Menu Management
- `SystemMenu` entity links menu items to roles, controlling sidebar visibility per user role
- Portal Admins can edit menu visibility via `/tools/editsystemmenus`
- Menu state evaluated server-side in `_SideMenuPartial.cshtml`

### Performance & Caching
`IMemoryCache` is used across several hot paths to avoid repeated database round-trips:

| Cache key pattern | TTL | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| `company:{id}:meta` | 15 min | `AdminController` on company edit/toggle |
| `appsettings:cats:{companyId}` | 30 min | `AppSettingsService` on category write |
| `appsettings:vals:{companyId}` | 30 min | `AppSettingsService` on setting write |
| `user:{userId}:roles` | 2 min | `CurrentUserService.InvalidateRolesCache()` |
| `workflows:{companyId}` | 5 min | `WorkflowController` on create/update/delete |
| `roles:dropdown` | 10 min | Not explicitly invalidated (role changes are infrequent) |
| `sites:dropdown:{companyId}` | 10 min | Not explicitly invalidated (site changes are infrequent) |

All EF Core read-only queries use `AsNoTracking()`. All async controller actions accept and propagate `CancellationToken`.

Response caching (HTTP layer) is applied to chart data and dropdown endpoints:
- Dashboard donut and bar chart endpoints — 30-second `Cache-Control`
- Reports permit-holder dropdown — 60-second `Cache-Control`

### Audit & Security
- All CRUD operations logged with timestamp and user (`AuditLog` entity)
- Automatic audit interception via EF Core interceptor
- Session-based access control with multi-tenant data isolation

## User Roles

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| **Super User** | Cross-tenant system access; manages companies via `/admin` portal |
| **Portal Admin** | Company-level administration |
| **User** | Standard access — view and submit permits |
| **Permit Issuer** | Can issue and approve permits |
| **Lead Permit Issuer** | Senior issuer with elevated approval authority |
| **Authorized Gas Tester** | Specialist role for gas-testing operations on confined space / hot work permits |
| **Permit Holder / Contractor** | Combined external role — treated as contractor for access control |
| **Worker** | Field worker — limited to assigned permits |
| **Contractor** | External contractor — restricted access |

Roles support soft-delete via `ISoftDeletable` and carry audit fields (`CreatedWhen`, `UpdatedWhen`, `CreatedBy`, `UpdatedBy`). The `IsSystemRole` flag marks roles that should not be deleted or renamed by tenant admins. Deleted roles are recoverable from the **Recycle Bin → Roles** tab.

`Role` is a shared entity (no `CompanyId`) — the same role catalog is used across all tenants. Because of this, the Roles grid and the "users in this role" panel on the Edit Role page both scope their user counts to the company currently being managed, not the global count across every tenant. The role-deletion guard, however, still checks the true global count, since deleting a shared role affects every company using it.

**Normalized Name (slug)**
- Set once at role creation via a dedicated **Normalized Name** field, separate from the display `Name`
- Auto-suggested in real time via JavaScript as the user types the Role Name (uppercased, non-letters stripped: `nameInput.value.toUpperCase().replace(/[^A-Z]/g, '')`), but remains manually editable until the user overrides it
- Validated server-side (`^[A-Z]+$` — uppercase letters only, no spaces/digits/symbols) and checked for uniqueness against `Role.NormalizedName`
- Immutable after creation: the Edit Role form renders it `readonly`, and `EditRole` (POST) explicitly restores the original value after `RoleManager.UpdateAsync` — ASP.NET Identity's `RoleManager` always re-derives `NormalizedName` from `Name` on every create/update, so the original slug is re-applied post-save to keep role lookups (e.g. `role.NormalizedName == "SUPERUSER"`) stable even if the display name changes later

**Unlimited Users flag**
- `Role.IsUnlimitedUsers` — set via a checkbox on the role create/edit form
- Users assigned a role marked unlimited are excluded from the company's `UserCreateLimit` count (see **User Creation Limits** below)

### User Creation Limits
- `UserCreateLimit` (from the `user_create_limit` app setting) caps the number of users per company
- The count excludes users whose role has `IsUnlimitedUsers = true`
- Once a company reaches its limit, the **New User** role dropdown is restricted server-side to only unlimited-users roles (`UsersController.GetSelectableUserRoles`) — an info banner explains why
- If no unlimited-users role exists, the New User page falls back to a full block message instead of an empty dropdown
- The restriction is re-validated on `POST` (not just the dropdown) to reject a tampered submission that selects a non-unlimited role after the limit is reached

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- SQL Server (local or remote instance)
- Node.js (optional, for asset builds)

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd PermitPro-1.2
   ```

2. Configure the connection string in `Web/appsettings.Development.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "Development": "Server=localhost;Database=PermitPro;Trusted_Connection=True;"
     }
   }
   ```

3. Set required environment variables (via `launchSettings.json` or shell):
   ```
   HANGFIRE_DB_CONNECTION    - Hangfire scheduler database connection string
   SUSPEND_AUTORESUME_DAYS   - Days before suspended permits auto-resume (default: 10)
   UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE      - Max attachment size in bytes (default: 3 MB)
   UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_COUNT     - Max attachments per permit (default: 5)
   UPLOAD_ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES - Comma-separated allowed types (default: pdf,docx,jpg,jpeg,png)
   USER_CREATE_LIMIT         - Max users per company (default: 15)
   RESERVED_ROLES            - Roles restricted from assignment (e.g. SUPERUSER,PORTALADMIN)
   ```

4. Configure `appsettings.json` sections:
   ```json
   {
     "JwtSettings": {
       "Issuer": "<issuer>",
       "Audience": "<audience>",
       "SecretKey": "<secret>"
     },
     "EmailSettings": { ... },
     "PTWSettings": { ... }
   }
   ```

5. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project Core --startup-project Web
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project Web
   ```

   Default URLs:
   - HTTP: `http://localhost:5144`
   - HTTPS: `https://localhost:7079`

### First-Time Setup

1. Create a `SUPERUSER` role and assign it to an admin account directly in the database (or via seed).
2. Navigate to `/admin/login` and sign in with that account.
3. Create your first company from `/admin/companies`.
4. Tenant users log in at `/account/login` and select their company from the dropdown.

### Docker / MSSQL

To restore a SQL Server backup into a Docker container:
```bash
docker cp sql.bak <container-id>:/var/opt/mssql/data
```

Then restore via `sqlcmd` or SQL Server Management Studio.

- Session timeout: 60 minutes
- Cookies: HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict
- Data protection tokens expire after 30 minutes

### PTW Certificate Types (`appsettings.json` → `PTWSettings`)
Configurable certificate types mapped to permit form workflows.

---

## Database

Entity Framework Core with SQL Server. Key entities (26 total):

| Entity | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Company` | Multi-tenant root; holds name, logo filename, and active state |
| `Site` | Work sites with GPS coordinates |
| `SitePermit` | Junction table linking sites to permits |
| `UserSite` | Junction table linking users to sites |
| `Permit` | Safety permits with status lifecycle |
| `Workflow` / `WorkflowStep` | Approval workflow definitions |
| `WorkflowHistory` | Audit trail of workflow transitions |
| `UserInfo` | Extended ASP.NET Identity user |
| `Certificate` | Safety certifications per permit |
| `Attachment` | Files attached to permits |
| `Notification` | User notification records (Title, Message, read/archived state) |
| `AuditLog` | Full CRUD change log |
| `LogInfo` | Application-level log records |
| `Division` / `Department` | Organisational structure |
| `Address` | Company address records |
| `Contact` | Company contact records (typed via `ContactTypeEnum`) |
| `PermitNumber` | Sequential permit numbering per company |
| `SystemMenu` | Role-based menu visibility configuration |
| `AppSettingCategory` | Per-company grouping for key-value settings |
| `AppSetting` | Per-company key-value configuration (unique on CompanyId + CategoryId + Key) |
| `HotWork` / `ConfinedSpace` | Certificate sub-entities (in `Entities/Certificates/`) |
| `FormSectionInfo` | Permit form section metadata (in `Entities/Forms/`) |

All core entities support soft-delete via `ISoftDeletable`. Hard deletes are not performed by the application by default (`UseSoftDelete = true`). `Role` (via ASP.NET Identity) also implements `ISoftDeletable` with full audit fields.

### Migration history

| Migration | Description |
|---|---|
| `InitialCreate` | Base schema |
| `AddNewProperty-PreviousPermitStatus-Permit` | Tracks previous permit status |
| `AddedNewProperties-Permit-01` | Additional permit fields |
| `AddSoftDelete` | `IsDeleted` / `DeletedWhen` / `DeletedBy` on all core entities |
| `AddNotificationTitle` | `Title` column on `Notification` |
| `AddRoleAuditFields` | Audit fields on `Role` |
| `AddRoleDescription` | `Description` and `IsSystemRole` on `Role` |
| `AddAppSettings` | `AppSettingCategory` and `AppSetting` tables |
| `AddCompanyLogo` | `LogoFileName` on `Company` |
| `AddRoleIsUnlimitedUsers` | `IsUnlimitedUsers` flag on `Role` |

Run migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName> --project Core --startup-project Web
dotnet ef database update --project Core --startup-project Web
```

---

## Deployment

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-on-merge.yml` triggers when a pull request is merged into `master`:

1. Checkout code
2. Setup .NET 10.0
3. Restore → Build (Release) → Publish (self-contained, win-x64, ReadyToRun)
4. Deploy to **SmarterASP.NET** via WebDeploy

Deployment secrets are stored in GitHub repository settings (not in source).

### WebDeploy (Manual)

Target host: SmarterASP.NET  
Deployment user: `[YOUR_WEB_DEPLOY_USERNAME]`

## Security Notes

- Do not commit credentials, API keys, or connection strings to source control
- Use environment variables or secrets management for sensitive configuration
- The `RESERVED_ROLES` environment variable restricts certain role assignments (SUPERUSER, PORTALADMIN)
- All audit events are written to `AuditLog` and are non-deletable by application users
- JWT `SecretKey` must be stored securely and never committed to source control
- The Super Admin portal (`/admin/*`) is protected by the `SUPERUSER` role check on every action — regular tenant users are rejected at login, not just redirected
- Authentication endpoints are rate-limited: **10 requests per 5-minute window per IP** (policy: `"auth"`, HTTP 429 on breach) — applied via ASP.NET Core's built-in `UseRateLimiter` middleware
